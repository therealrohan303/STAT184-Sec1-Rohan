# Introduction
This repository explores potential gender biases in UC Berkeleyâ€™s admissions process using the 1973 dataset provided for analysis. The goal was to evaluate whether gender played a significant role in admission outcomes, as per the plaintiff's claim in a lawsuit. The dataset includes information about applicants, their gender, admission decisions, and the majors they applied to. The findings are documented in a Quarto notebook.
